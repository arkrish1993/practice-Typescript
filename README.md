# practice-Typescript

--To install Typescript--
npm install typescript
(add -g if global installation is needed)

--To compile Typescript code:--
npx tsc filename
This will show the compilation errors, if any and also create a .js file based on the .ts file that we create. This is done because the TS code cannot be run in the browser.
